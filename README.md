An android quiz app. (that is poorly made, and not even finished yet)

## Usage
### Api
1. Write your Supabase API key (anon) with the variable name ``` ANON ```.
2. Open a terminal in the ``` api ``` folder.
3. Run ``` npm run start ``` to start the api server. The server runs on port 3000.

### Application
1. In the file ``` lib/http_request.dart ``` change ``` apiUrl ``` to your api url.
2. Build the app using ``` flutter build apk ``` and install the apk on your android phone.

## Notice
This project is not complete. Lots of features are not in the app. Some features that may be important are not 
in the app, but will be added in the future. (Ran out of allowed hours for a project on HackClub.)
